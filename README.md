# dd2394-Security-Project (Quantum cryptography)

## Problem statement
 - Implement a quantum key sharing protocols (BB84 and E91) in Qiskit, a python quantum programming library. The implementation will be executed by running quantum circuits on a simulator(QiskitAer)

### Deliverables

#### BB84
- Implement a basic BB84 protocol (without eavesdropping)
- Implement noise and spot checking
- Implement eavesdropping and risk of exposure
- Set up test cases (W & Wo eavesdropping, W & Wo noise)
#### E91
- Implement a basic E91 protocol 
- Implement CHSH of the protocol, and begin using noise
- Implement eavesdropping and risk of exposure
- Set up test cases (W & Wo eavesdropping, W & Wo noise)
#### Key reconciliation
- As it's uncertain whether the keys are identical (due to noise and/or eavesdropping), we need to reconcile the two keys to be  certain that they are the same.
#### Privacy amplification
- Take a key and run it through a hash function to minimize the information that eavesdropping can gather from the key.

## Documentation of the project

### BB84

### E91

## Documentation of testing the project

### Dependencies:
- Have python 3 installed
- `pip install qiskit`
- `pip install qiskit_aer`

## Contribution: 

To improve efficiency, we split the work into two parts based on the two protocols. While Alex and Anton worked on BB84, Trang and Jonatan worked on E91. 

### Anton Br√∂mster
As mentioned previously, I worked on the BB84 protocol. But to be more specific, this is what I contributed:

- **Implementation of the BB84 protocol**: Updated the basic version of the protocol that was orginially made by Jonatan. This mostly consisted of making a new output format and altering the structure of the program.  
- **Eavesdropping and noise simulation**: Implemented features to simulate eavesdropping attempts and noise. This included changes in bb84.py and bb84_eaves.py. 
- **Test cases**: Implemented test cases for verification of the of the BB84 protocol. This included cases where eavedropping and noise wasn't used, and cases where they were used. 
- **Documentation**: Drafted the first version of the `README.md` page. This included sections: problem statement, deliverables and references.
