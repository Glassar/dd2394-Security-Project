# DD2391 Security Project - Quantum Key Distribution
The purpose of this project is to implement quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols to securely exchange cryptographic keys. Specifically, the BB84 and E91 protocols were implemented using the Qiskit Python library and quantum simulators to showcase how quantum communication can detect eavesdropping. We simulated noise, eavesdropping and applied methods such as key reconiliation and privacy amplification to enhance security.

## Problem description
Quantum mechanics and quantum computing offers a new way of cryptographic key distribution that is fundamentally secure against undetected eavesdropping. This security stems from a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics: any measurement of a quantum state changes the state itself. In other words, if an eavesdropper intercepts and measures the quantum state before it reaches the intended recipient, the state will be altered, allowing both parties to detect the intrusion. 

Using this quality, several QKD protocols have been developed to securely transmit cryptographic keys over open and insecure channels, with the assertion that any unauthorized access to the key will be revealed. 

### Protocols
For this project, we have chosen to implement two QKD protocols, specifically the BB84 and E91 protocols. These implementations will be carried out using the Qiskit Python quantum programming library, with the quantum circuits executed on the Qiskit Aer simulator.

### Interference Tests
In addition to implementing the basic key distribution protocols, we also implemented eavesdropping detection mechanisms for both protocols. These mechanisms use statistical methods to identify deviations in the results between the two parties, indicating the presence of interference that would not occur under normal conditions. 

Such interference arises either from noise, given that quantum computers are not foolproof and gate operations or measurements can produce incorrect values, or from eavesdropper intercepting the key distribution and altering the transmitted quantum states. Therefore, if the detection protocol return an interference level greater than our safety threshold, then we conclude that eavesdropping has occured and subsequently discard the results.

### Eavesdropping
Eavesdropping was integrated into both protocols, with an eavesdropper, referred to as Eve, intercepting and measuring a few of the transmissions while ensuring that some information is forwarded to Bob for measurement. However, due to the randomness in how the information is transmitted, which is undetectable, Eve cannot carry out this process perfectly, meaning that there will be interference which we can detect. 

### Key Reconciliation and Privacy Amplification
Key reconciliation and privacy amplification are crucial steps in QKD protocols as they help ensure that two parties can established a secret key over a insecure channel. Due to the inherent noise in quantum processes, errors will inevitably occur resulting in Alice's and Bob's keys not being completely identical, even in the absence of eavesdropping. Therefore, to ensure that the final key is usable, these errors must be removed. To reconcile their keys, we implemented an error correction protocol known as the *cascade protocol* which corrects any remaining errors Bob's key relative to Alice's key while revealing minimal information and maintaining a high probability of successfully reconciling the two keys.

However, since this process requires us to send information over an insecure channel, we conclude the key distribution process with privacy amplification. The concept of privacy amplification exploits the limited knowledge that the eavesdropper, Eve, has of the initial key which may have been acquired through either eavesdropping of the key distribution or the key reconciliation process. Privacy amplification is achieved by performing a simple has function on the key.

## Background
### Crash Course in Quantum Computing
Quantum computing works by applying quantum gates to a system of qubits and subsequently evaluating the values of these qubits. Qubits are the quantum equivalent of a classical bit and can be represented as a two-dimensional complex vector. The absolute value of these complex numbers correspond to the probability of measuring the qubit in the states 0 and 1, respectively. 

For our protocols, we only used a few different quantum gates:

- H (Hadamard) gates puts a qubit in superposition. When applying the Hadamard gate to a qubit, it transitions into a state of equal probability of measuring either 0 or 1. If a qubit is already in a state then it returns it to its classical state.

- X (Pauli-X) gate is a *NOT* gate that flips the state of a qubit from |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa.

- S (Phase) and T (T-phase) gates rotates the complex vector, 90 degrees and 45 degrees, respectively, in a way which doesn't directly affect the probability of measuring 0 or 1.

- CX gate is a controlled NOT gate, which flips the first qubit if and only if the second qubit is in the state |1⟩ (but if the second qubit only has a certain probability of evaluating to 1 then it only switches the first one with a certain probability).

### Bell Circuit
A bell circuit (see Figure 1) is a simple two qubit system which will evaluate with equal odds to either |00⟩ or |11⟩, but never |10⟩ or |01⟩ (if we ignore noise). 

![alt text](image.png)

Figure 1: Quantum circuit for implementing the first Bell state.  

We start with two quibits in the |0⟩ state. First, we  apply a Hadamard (H) gate fo the first qubit, putting it into a superposition with equal likelihoods to evaluate to either 0 or 1. Then we apply a CX gate to both of the qubits, where the first qubit controls the second. That is, if the first qubit evaluates to 1, then we will set the seccond qubit to 1. And this will hold even if we separate the first qubit and the second one by for example, sending one to Alice and one to Bob, meaning they now have a shared secret bit. 

### The Assumptions of the Project
The quantum protocols used in this project requires these following communication conditions: the quantum communication is done over a completely open and unsecure channel, and the later comparison of bases as well as key reconciliation is done over an open but **authenticated** classical channel.

### BB84 
The BB84 protocol was developed by Charles H. Bennett and Gilles Brassard in 1984 and it utilises a single qubit system. In this protocol, Alice randomly selects a string of bits and a string of one of two bases: either the horizontal/vertical (0/1) or diagional (+45°/-45°) states. She then transmits a photon for each bit with the corresponding polarization to Bob. Bob randomly chooses a bases to measure each bit he recieves. If he chose the same bases as Alice for a particular bit, then Bob will with a 100% certainty measure the same value as Alice wrote (disregarding noise). However if they have different bases then what Bob measures will be completely random. 

Finally Alice and Bob share their randomly generated bases, and discard any bits where they had different bases, and the resulting string form their shared secret key. 

### E91
The E91 protocol was created by Artur Ekert in 1991 and is slightly more complex than BB84. This method relies on a Bell circuit that generates a pair of entangled qubits—one of which is sent to Alice and the other to Bob. Both Alice and Bob generate a random series of bases (one for each bit sent), but now they select from three possible bases, which are different rotations of the qubits. In our example, Alice and Bob share only two of the three angles in common, but they could theoretically chose these bases randomly out of a selection.

Both Alice and Bob measures each bit they recieve using one of the three bases of their choosing. Alice then flips her bit as if they have the same base, then Alice's bit is guaranteed to be the opposite of Bob's (disregarding noise), while if they have different bases then their measurement's are a bit random.

Finally Alice and Bobs share their lists of bases and discard any bits where they don't share a base, and they now have two identical keys.

## Deliverables
This repository includes implementations of two quantum key distribution protocols, E91 and BB84. The protocols are implemented in Python, using Qiskit and Qiskit Aer, and simulates the key exchange between two users (Alice and Bob), while also including noise models and eavesdropping. Additionally, the repository includes a key reconciliation technique, used to fix key inconsistensies, and also privacy amplification. The code for each protocol can be located within their corresponding folder [bb84](/bb84) and [e91](/e91). 

### BB84
Within the [bb84](/bb84) folder, there are five python scripts: 
- [bb84.py](/bb84/bb84.py) - This file implements the BB84 protocol, which includes a key exchange between two parties - Alice and Bob. Due to this being the most "basic" version of BB84, it does not include any eavesdropping. However, it can include noise. This can be included when running the main file. Also, to run the `main` function, a variable object is required. An example of such object can be found within the [test-file](/bb84/bb84_test.py) (named `config`).
- [bb84_eaves.py](/bb84/bb84_eaves.py) - The structure of this file is quite similar to that of `bb84.py`, with the difference being the inclusion of eavesdropping. That being said, the `main` function is ran the same way as `bb84.py`, with the difference being the inclusion of parameter `threshhold`.
- [bb84_test.py](/bb84/bb84_test.py) - This is the test file, used to try the bb84-protocol. It includes a series of tests, each including different values (i.e. with/without noise and with/without eavesdropping). **To run the test, run command `python3 ./bb84/bb84_test.py` in your terminal**
- [noise.py](/bb84/noise.py) - The noise file contains the noise protocol. It is defined as a function, called `noise_protocol`, and is used to insert noise into the process of key exchange. 
- [spot_checking.py](/bb84/spot_checking.py) - The spot checking file includes the function `spot_checking` which calculates the number of incorrect bits out of a random sample of Bob's key. 

[comment]: <> (The sample size is based on parameter `numberOfBits`, and the function will return three values - `error rate, Alice's sample, and Bob's sample`.)

### E91
Within the [e91](/e91) folder, one should find one python script, namely [e91.py](/e91/e91.py). Other than key exchange, the file also gives the option to simulate eavesdropper. To run the code, run the `sync_bases_and_build_keys` function. More information about the code will be presented under [Documentation of the project](#documentatiohn-of-the-project).

#### Key reconciliation and privacy amplification
Aside the two folders for the respective protocols, there exist another folder. This folder, called [key_reconciliation](/key_reconciliation), includes code that relates to key reconciliation and privacy amplification. Within said folder, one should find a file called [key_reconciliation.py](/key_reconciliation/key_reconciliation.py). More information about the code will be presented under [Documentation of the project](#documentatiohn-of-the-project).

The [file](/bb84/bb84_test.py) used for testing contains a total of five different test cases, each with their different values. 
- Test case 1: The first test case used the `bb84.py` code, and performs a key exchange without noise and eavesdropping. 
- Test case 2: The second test case also used the `bb84.py` code. However, this time, it includes noise. 
- Test case 3: The third test, which used the `bb84_eaves.py`, includes eavesdropping (but no noise). 
- Test case 4: The fourth test is quite similar to test case 3, as it also executes the `bb84_eaves.py` code, but with the difference being that it includes noise,
- Test case 5: The fifth test case is the same as test case 4, with the difference being the inclusion of key reconciliation.

### E91



## Contribution
To improve efficiency, the work was split into two parts based on the two protocols. While Alex and Anton worked on BB84, Jonatan and Trang worked on E91. 

### Alex Shariat Zadeh
- **Key reconciliation in the BB84 and E91 protocol**: Implemented method that makes keys match since its uncertain if the keys are identical due to the noise or eavesdropping, reconciles the two keys to be the same, by comparing segments of their respective keys and correcting differences while revealing minimal information.
- **Privacy amplification in BB84 and E91**: Implemented using hash function to hash keys in order to safeguard them from potential eavesdropping.
- **Test cases**: Implemented test cases for above
- **Documentation**: Wrote documentation about BB84 protocol and Key reconciliation and Privacy amplification

### Anton Brömster
As mentioned previously, I worked on the BB84 protocol. But to be more specific, this is what I contributed:

- **Implementation of the BB84 protocol**: Updated the basic version of the protocol that was orginially made by Jonatan. This mostly consisted of making a new output format and altering the structure of the program.  
- **Eavesdropping and noise simulation**: Implemented features to simulate eavesdropping attempts and noise. This included changes in bb84.py and bb84_eaves.py. 
- **Test cases**: Implemented test cases for verification of the of the BB84 protocol. This included cases where eavedropping and noise wasn't used, and cases where they were used. 
- **Documentation**: Drafted the first version of the `README.md` page. This included sections: problem statement, deliverables and references.
